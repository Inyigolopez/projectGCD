========================================================

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

I have read each of the files in a variable. I added the variable 'subject' and 'activity' at first. I joined the training data with the test and have subsequently added the variable 'Y', which I have added to his descriptive values
